# gremlin-ogm
A PHP Object Graph Mapper for Tinkerpop 3+ compatible Graph Databases (JanusGraph, Neo4j, etc.) that allows you to persist data and run gremlin queries.

Note: Still a work in progress. I'm progressively open sourcing the code I use in production with JanusGraph. If you use Symfony, then there's a bundle I'm finishing on that will allow you to map Doctrine ORM entities from a compatible RDBMS database as well as Doctrine ODM documents from MongoDB to a Graph Database.
